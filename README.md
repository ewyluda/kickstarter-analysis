#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

##Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze kickstarter data from theaters and plays and study any trends that were found.

##Analysis Challenge
Data for this challenge was provided and I began by filtering the data to study the relationships for theaters and plays only, as called for in the challenge. The data was kept intact and the only fields that were added were calculations from the provided data, such as converting the linux timecode to typical date format for the creation and ending dates, calcuating the average donation per backer, and further categorizing the data by parent category and subcategory. I did not encounter any challenges in the analysis.

##Results
The number of successful outcomes was the highest in May and was overall the highest between the months of May and March. For outcomes based on goals, trends were not as clear. From the charts produced, the goal range of 35000-45000 produced the most failures and the goal range of 0-5000 produced the most success. From this we can conclude that kickstarter campaigns that are produced in the months between May and October and have goals of less than 5000 are the most successful.
